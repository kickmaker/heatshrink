	bool "Heatshrink data compression"
	help
	  This option enables heatshrink compression library
	  support.

	help
	  Use memory dynamic allocation.

	int "Input buffer length"

	help
	  Determine input buffer to use for the decoder.

	int "Window size"
	default 8
	range 4 15
	help
	  Determine how far back in the input can be searched for
	  repeated pattern. Memory footprint is 2^(Window size).
	  Ex.: Window size of 8 takes 2^8 (256) bytes.
	  Compromise between resource usage vs compression efficiency.

config HEATSHRINK_STATIC_LOOKAHEAD_BITS
	int "Lookahead size"
	default 4
	range 3 14
	help
	  Determine the max length for repeated patterns that are found.
	  Memory footprint is 2^(Lookahead size).
	  Larger size means more complex pattern could be largely reduced.
